# Java Cloud Computing: Patient-Data
Read in a CSV file filled with patient data, and then displayed it such that users can interact with the UI and search for information. 

 - Created a POJO (plain old Java object) class to store the details about the patients.
 - Wrote a class JSONFormatter that returned a JSON representation of a single patient and for all patients. (JSON library was not used, written by myself).
 - Displayed the list of patient names on a web page and clicking on a name shows the data for that patient. 
 - Allowed the user to filter the patients through categories.
 - Provided a collection of basic analytics functions
